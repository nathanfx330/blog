My first word processor was ClarisWorks on Mac OS 8 back in the late nineties. Since then, nothing has really changed. There is still a digital white sheet, a virtual piece of paper. Fast forward through years of Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs, and they all felt the same. I dislike looking at a fake digital white sheet of paper. Moving and editing text with a cursor is a character by character chore when there is no easy way to organize or rearrange blocks of writing. Writing should be about abstracting ideas, exploring structure, and developing details, not constantly wrestling with the interface.  
  
So I made Node Writer. It is not just a word processor; it is an engine that lets you build your outline, rearrange your thoughts, and experiment with different versions of your work all within a single two-dimensional canvas. Each paragraph exists as a node that you can move, edit, or connect to other nodes. This approach allows you to see your writing as a network of ideas instead of a single line of text. You can focus on the relationships between paragraphs, the flow of your story, and the structure of your argument without losing your place in the process. Node Writer turns writing into a visual and modular experience where ideas are easy to shift, expand, or compress without losing their context.

I recently released Node Writer. On its own, it was my response to the skeuomorphic persistence of digital paper and the blinking cursor. Traditional editors still assume writing happens linearly, as if ideas arrive fully formed from top to bottom. Node Writer challenges that assumption by abstracting writing into nodes — movable units of thought that can be stacked, rearranged, and explored spatially rather than sequentially.

But that release was only the first milestone.

Phase two is the integration of local AI as a writing companion. Instead of sending isolated prompts into a chat window, Node Writer allows any version of your work to be stacked directly from the nodal interface and passed into Ollama, where it can be processed by the model of your choice. Draft variations, structural experiments, alternate arguments, or exploratory rewrites can all exist simultaneously and be evaluated without breaking the flow of writing itself.

The goal is not automation. It is amplification. AI becomes another node in the thinking process — something you consult, compare against, or iterate with while maintaining ownership of structure and intent.

So far, it has been working better than I expected. Writing begins to feel less like editing a document and more like navigating a living system of ideas.
